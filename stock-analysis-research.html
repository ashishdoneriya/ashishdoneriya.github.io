When comparing its sales growth with the self sustainable growth rate (SSGR) for the last seven years, whenever it grows beyond its SSGR, debt increases. At present its SSGR is ~20% but sales growth is 31%. And either it grows either above 22 or below 10. In the latest quarter they have reduced borrowings by improving inventory turnover and reducing debtor days. Need to find moat of this company. Cannot buy just because it reduced its debt in the latest quarter.</p><h3 id=balkrishna-industries-ltd>Balkrishna Industries Ltd</h3><p>A good company, a lot of FCF, but, for the past 3 years increasing beyond its capacity (SSGR). PEG ratio is 2 and current (Nov 2019) PEG ratio is 3.7. OPM varies between 19% - 30%, therefore profit might go down and share price could slump any time. A lot of ongoing capital intensive projects and in company&rsquo;s annual report have clearly mentioned they could use debt. Company is not able to reduce its debt at a significant rate and they are taking about borrowing more money. I think, first company should reduce debt to a significant level and then increase plants. Also they are showing that they have very high interest coverage ratio (114) but in reality it is not. According to my very rough estimation, it should be around 10. Should wait for some quarters and check its borrowings before investing in this company. Also I couldn&rsquo;t find company&rsquo;s existing clients and its plan to acquire more client agreements but I read somewhere that company is facing difficulty getting new clients and therefore will focus more on existing clients. Company&rsquo;s 1/3 of revenue comes from cyclic industry.</p><h3 id=caplin-point-laboratories-ltd>Caplin Point Laboratories Ltd</h3><p>cPAT > cCFO, no credit ratings, debtor days sharply increasing check why profit down, Analze further

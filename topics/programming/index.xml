&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An Algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An Algorithm is a set of steps of operations to solve a problem performing calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An Algorithm is the best way to represent the solution of a particular problem in a very simple and efficient way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Algorithm is independent from any programming languages.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

<a class=text-decoration-none href=/topics/finance rel=category>Finance</a></div><div class=post-content><p>There was once a pharma company in Gujarat called Shakti Pharma. Founded by Rameshbhai, a no-nonsense, first-generation businessman, it made solid medicines and sold them across India.</p><p>Every year, revenue grew. The sales charts looked great.
But every time Ramesh checked his bank account at month-end, it felt like a scam.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is the bloody cash?&rdquo;</p><p>That one question started a journey. A journey that had nothing to do with profit… and everything to do with how money moves inside a business.</p><h2 id=debtor-days---the-waiting-game>Debtor Days - The Waiting Game</h2><p>The first shock was about customer payments.</p><p>Ramesh thought: <strong>I sold the medicine. They’ll pay next week, right?</strong></p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Some paid in 60 days. Some in 90. One government hospital took 120 days and still delayed.</p><p>His accountant explained: <strong>&ldquo;Sir, our average Debtor Days is around 75. That means, from the day you bill someone, you wait 75 days to get paid.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ramesh stared at the ceiling.
<strong>&ldquo;So the sale is real - but the cash is imaginary for 2.5 months.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Exactly.</p><h2 id=inventory-days---the-pile-of-dead-money>Inventory Days - The Pile of Dead Money</h2><p>Next came the godown.</p><p>Everywhere he looked, there were cartons of finished goods. Ready but unsold. Medicines, syrups, injectables… just sitting.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Why is this not moving?&rdquo;</strong> he asked.</p><p>The warehouse guy shrugged, <strong>&ldquo;This is normal, sir. We have around 3 months of inventory.&rdquo;</strong></p><p><strong>&ldquo;THREE MONTHS?&rdquo;</strong></p><p>That’s when he learned about Inventory Days - how long stock sits before it gets sold.</p><p>That’s not just boxes. That’s cash lying on the floor, doing nothing.</p><h2 id=days-payable---the-only-good-news>Days Payable - The Only Good News</h2><p>Now he looked at the flip side.</p><p>They bought chemicals, bottles, and caps from vendors. But… did they pay instantly?</p><p>Nope. The vendors gave 60- to 75-day payment terms.</p><p>That was a relief.</p><p>His accountant said: <strong>&ldquo;Sir, this is called Days Payable. You take 75 days to pay suppliers. That’s working in your favour.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ramesh smirked. <strong>&ldquo;So finally, someone else is funding my business.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Correct.</p><h2 id=cash-conversion-cycle---the-true-pain-point>Cash Conversion Cycle - The True Pain Point</h2><p>Then came the full picture.</p><p>The accountant drew a simple timeline:</p><ul><li>Day 0: Raw material arrives</li><li>Day 1–90: It sits in inventory</li><li>Day 91: Product is sold</li><li>Day 91–167: Customer takes 76 more days to pay</li></ul><p>So Ramesh’s money returns on Day 167. But when did it leave?</p><p>Not Day 0.
He only pays the supplier on Day 75.</p><p>So his own money is stuck from Day 75 to Day 167 - exactly 92 days.</p><p>That’s the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) - the number of days your own cash is trapped inside the system.</p><p>Not from sale to sale.
From money going out of your hand to money coming back in.</p><h2 id=working-capital-days---the-cash-you-need-before-you-even-open-the-shop>Working Capital Days - The Cash You Need Before You Even Open the Shop</h2><p>One afternoon, Ramesh sat with his accountant, looking at how much cash was left.</p><p>The accountant said softly,<br><strong>&ldquo;Sir, your working capital days are 90.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ramesh looked up.<br><strong>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</strong></p><p>The accountant didn’t pull out a spreadsheet. He just said:</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Sir, think of it like this - you run a business that sells medicine every day.&rdquo;</strong></p><p><strong>&ldquo;But today, even before you sell anything, your money is already busy somewhere.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ramesh asked, &ldquo;Busy where?&rdquo;</p><p>The accountant said:</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Some money is used to buy materials and make stock - it’s lying in your godown.&rdquo;</strong><br><strong>&ldquo;Some money is still with customers - you gave them goods, but they haven’t paid yet.&rdquo;</strong><br><strong>&ldquo;And yes, some money you still have to pay to your suppliers - that will go later.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ramesh listened quietly.</p><p>Then the accountant said:</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Now if I take all that - your stock money, customer money, and supplier dues - and do some maths, it tells me this:<br>To keep this business running, without even growing, you need to block money equal to 90 days of sales.&rdquo;</strong></p><p><strong>&ldquo;That’s working capital days.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ramesh thought for a second.<br><strong>&ldquo;So I need three months of sales money already locked - just to stay normal?&rdquo;</strong></p><p>The accountant nodded.<br><strong>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Even if you don’t take one extra order tomorrow - this much money is always stuck inside the machine.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>And that’s when it made sense.</p><p>He didn’t need any chart.<br>He just wanted to know how deep the cash pit really was.</p><p>The accountant saw he was finally interested.</p><p>So he said, <strong>&ldquo;Sir, let me also show you how we calculate it - no formulas, just the logic.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>He picked up a notepad and wrote:</p><ul><li>You have ₹30 crore of stock lying in the factory and warehouse</li><li>You have ₹45 crore worth of customer bills still unpaid</li><li>You still owe ₹25 crore to vendors</li></ul><p><strong>&ldquo;So the money that’s fully stuck is ₹30 + ₹45 – ₹25 = ₹50 crore.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Then he said:</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Now we divide that ₹50 crore by your average daily sales.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ramesh nodded slowly.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;If you sell ₹55 crore a month, that’s around ₹1.83 crore per day.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>So:</p><p><strong>₹50 crore ÷ ₹1.83 crore/day ≈ 27 working capital days</strong></p><p>Ramesh was quiet.<br>Then he said,<br><strong>&ldquo;So I always need ₹50 crore parked, just to keep the engine running?&rdquo;</strong></p><p>The accountant nodded again.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Yes. That money never goes out. It just keeps going round and round - always inside.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>That was it.</p><p>Now, Ramesh didn’t just understand cash delay.</p><p>He understood <strong>cash depth.</strong></p><style>p strong{font-weight:500!important}</style></div></article></main><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js defer></script></body></html>
